This Repo contains the implementation of WC, A Unix command utilities.

The wc utility displays the number of lines, words, and bytes contained in each input file, or standard input (if no file is specified) to the standard output.  A line is defined as a string of
     characters delimited by a ⟨newline⟩ character.  Characters beyond the final ⟨newline⟩ character will not be included in the line count.
